What did I do last time?
	- Worked on mkdir and pushd
	- Collaborated with teammates regarding the implementation of Traverse
	  as well as Directory Stack.
	- Brainstormed the implement
What am I planning to do?
	- Fix the bugs for mkdir and pushd
	- Finish cd and popd
Is there something I am blocked on?
	- Waiting on the gathering to change the design implementation. So far
	  working with the same implementation.
