What did I do last time?
	- Solved bugs that wer showing up in the overall code.
	- Implemented find, but so far I don't know if it works with files
What am I planning to do?
	- Work on documentation.
	- Work on testing.
	- Change the find to work with files, if that is necessary.
Is there something I am blocked on?
	- Echo needs to be able to create files in order for find to be tested.
