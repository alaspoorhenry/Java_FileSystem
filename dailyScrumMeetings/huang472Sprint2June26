What did I do last time?
	- Made a Tree class which interacts with output
	- added error handling for Ls class
What am I planning to do?
	- Implement files and their respective commands
	- Reformatting the Commands.java class into an abstract class/interface for the other commands
Is there something I am blocked on?
	- Commands.java refactoring needs consensus from rest of the team.
	- How paths should be passed to my file commands
