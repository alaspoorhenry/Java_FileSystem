a) What did I work on last time? 
	- created class FSObjects, Directory and mostly finalized their implementation
	- created Traverse, Cd, Mkdir commands in dirCommands package and began working on them
	- discussed implementation of directory pathname as a parameter for the mkdir, Traverse, cd commands with teammates
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Finish Traverse and begin working on Mkdir and Cd
	- If time allows, begin deciding on what tasks to work on in sprint 2 and 
	begin working on tasks in that sprint backlog
	
c) Am I blocked on anything? 
	- Having Input, Command_Manager, Parse, and Validator completed would be nice as I need to know
	details on how the pathname should be stored and passed into commands which interact with Directory objects
