What did I do last time?
	-Discussed with team on how to implement unit testing, commenting, using polymorphism and other design patterns
	-Created and completed Mkfile, NotDirectoryException and UniqueNameException
	-Tweaked and completed File.java
What am I planning to do?
	-Comment and work on unit testing
	-Redo Commands.java
Is there something I am blocked on?
	-How to implement a better Commands.java that all other commands can interact with
