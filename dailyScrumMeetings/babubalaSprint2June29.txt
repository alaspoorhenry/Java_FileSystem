What did I do last time?
	-Tested man, it works
	-Core dir cmds tested
	-Discussed some ideas with team for files
What am I planning to do?
	- Change implementation of error handling to use exceptions
	- Start thinking about plans for Sprint 3
	- Sprint 3 will be our testing phase, so come up with ideas on how to test etc.
Is there something I am blocked on?
	- Other members need to throw exceptions in their code so i can catch them and deal with them.
