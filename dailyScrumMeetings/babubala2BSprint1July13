What did i do last time?
- Discussed with team on new design ideas for command manager that takes care of redirection,
-so essentially a better design to handle redirection.
-Worked on command curl, created class Curl and started implementation.
-Figured out how to use in-built URL class and how to make use of collaboration with Echo.

What am i planning to do?
-Figure out how to implement grep cmd; how to code understanding of regex and recursively searching
-directories etc.

Is there something I am blocked on?
-Not currently.
