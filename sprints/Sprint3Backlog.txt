//Sprint 2 Backlog.
June 29 to July 2 (unless extention, please extension?)

Note: Echo is not finished yet, which switches to this sprint.
Note: Command superclass was not created, which switches to this sprint.
Note: Find does not work yet with files, only with directories.

User Stories:
A.)As a user, I would like to find the path of files given specific directories to search.
B.)As a user, I would like to be able to create a file.		    
C.)As a user, I would like to add text to the contents of an already existing file.
D.)As a user, I would like to concatenate the contents of multiple files and output it
E.)As a user, I would like to output the contents of a file.

Specific tasks to be accomplished:

1.): We are creating a command super class that allows all other commands to inherit from, it essentially retains the blueprint for the commands, and executes.
2.): Do thorough testing of the commands.
	2.1.): Do the testing for mkdir, pushd, popd, history.
	2.2.): Do the testing for ls, pwd, tree.
	2.3.): Do the testing for cd, cat, man.
	2.4.): Do the testing for echo, find.
3.): Work on the documentation of the code.
	3.1): Do the documentation of the following: cd, mkdir, find, Traverse, pushd, popd, history.
	3.2): Do the documentation of ls, pwd, tree, mkfile, commands, NotDirectoryException, UniqueNameException, FSElement, Directory, File.
	3.3): Do the documentation of man, cat, output, Validator.
	3.4): Do the documentation of JShell, input, echo, parse, Command manager.
4.): Be able to close the scanner that stores input, so the window will close.

a-1: Implement the find class so that it works with files as well.
b-1/c-1/d-1: Work on the implementation of echo class so it can both override and append content.
e-1: Need to create a Cat class which works with the Output class (collaboration), with the Cat command able to take care of
             being given multiple parameters that are files. Output will have a method that will simply print a String given.
